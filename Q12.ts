// Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.
let h=["Hassan", "Farhan" , "Zayan"]
console.log(h[0]+ " is my friend")
console.log(h[1]+ " is my friend")
console.log(h[2]+ " is my friend")
